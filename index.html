                                <p>
                                    Humans explored the underwater world long before <i>Scuba</i> was ever invented. Since the start of time, people collected pearls or seafood to eat, from the ocean floor. They used heavy rocks as weights and <b>held their breath</b>, or had air supplied from the surface with makeshift snorkels.
                                </p>
			
                                <p>
                                    By the 1600s new inventions had emerged to be used for <b>scientific discovery</b> and <b>wreck salvage</b>. One such was the <i>Diving Bell</i>, where the divers <em>entire body</em> was inside a <b>giant bell</b>, with air pumped into it. In the 1800s the <i>Diving Helmet</i> was created, which allowed the diver <b>more freedom</b> as <em>only the head</em> was encased in the helmet. 
                                </p>
            
                                <p>
                                    Many attempts were made in the 1800s to create a <b>self contained</b> system, in that the diver would carry their <em>own</em> air supply, and not have to be supplied from the surface.

                                                    Known as the "father of scuba diving" <i>Jacques Cousteau</i> invented the <em>first</em> <i>Scuba Regulator</i>, that could supply the diver with air <b>on demand</b>, and was <b>self contained</b>. He called it the “Aqualung”. Jacques Cousteau set off on his boat, <i>The Calypso</i>, on a decades long <b>underwater exploration adventure</b>, documenting it all. His documentaries and books were hugely popular. Thanks to this Scuba diving went from being a purely <em>military</em> and commercial activity to a <em>recreational</em> sport, for anyone to enjoy.

                                            The first thing Scuba divers learn is how <b>pressure at depth</b> affects us. The following table illustrates how the <b>deeper we go</b> the <b>more pressure</b> is exerted and how volume <em>increases</em> while density <em>decreases</em>.

                                <em>At depth</em> the weight of the water above us <b>creates pressure</b> on our bodies. Because our bodies are <b>made of water</b> we do not feel that weight. But we have <b>air-spaces</b> that do. 
                            </p>
                
                            <p> 
                                The three main air-spaces:
                            </p>
                            
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ear and Sinus</li>
                                    <li>Mask</li>
                                    <li>Lungs</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                            <p>
                            
                                The <em>deeper we go</em> the more the air in these spaces <b>compresses</b>, which can cause pain if we don’t <b>equalize</b> (add air to) the air spaces
                            </p>
                
                                <p>
                                    To equalize the <b>ear and sinus</b> we simply <em>pinch our nose</em> and blow against it.
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To equalise the <b>mask</b> we <em>blow a little air</em> in to it  through our nose.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To equalise the <b>lungs</b> we just <em>continuously breath</em>.
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As illustrated in the table above, the volume of air <em>expands</em> as it gets shallower. This is why we <b>never hold our breath</b> when diving on Scuba, as with-out anywhere for the air to go our lungs will <em>over expand</em> and ..burst!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>It is very important to get full training before Scuba diving!!</strong>

                                            For the <b>pool skills</b> portion of the beginner course, you will learn approximately <b>25 practical techniques</b> that, together, make you a capable diver.

It’s very important to <b>not let go </b> as you cannot see to find it! The pool skills are <b>practicing for real life</b> and we would not want to lose our mask on a dive.

Slide the strap into place at the <b>crown of your head</b> and make sure it is not twisted. Then you <b>clear the water</b> from inside the mask by tilting your head back and blowing out your nose.

Breath out continuously (<b>remember to never hold your breath</b>). With your <em>right</em> hand <b>sweep back</b> to your tank and up and round to the front. The regulator hose will be on your right arm. Place it back in to your mouth (right way up) and <b>blow out</b> to clear the water.

                                        <p>
                                            Once you have mastered the equipment and the basic skills a very <b>important</b> technique to learn is <i>buoyancy control</i>. This allows you to go <b>where you want</b> in the water. Without controlling our buoyancy we could <b>crash to the bottom</b> or <b>float to the surface</b>. If we are <em>too heavy</em> and touch the bottom we risk <b>injuring ourselves</b> on sharp coral or disturbing marine life. If we <em>float up</em> we risk getting <i>Decompression Sickness</i> ("the bends"), or getting hit by a passing boat! 
                                        </p>
                
                                        <p> 
                                            We mostly use our <b>breathing</b> to control our buoyancy. When we <em>breath out</em> and empty our lungs of air we will <b>go down</b>. When we <em>inhale</em> and fill our lungs we will <b>go up</b>, just like emptying or filling a balloon underwater.

                                <h1> Underwater Navigation</h1>
                
                                        <p>
                                            Navigation <em>underwater</em> is very different to navigation <em>on land</em>. Even the <b>clearest</b> water and <b>simplest</b> dive site layout can prove a <b>challenge</b> to divers who haven’t honed their underwater navigation skills. 
                                        </p>
                       
                                        <p>
                                            There are two main ways to navigate on our dives, <b>natural navigation</b> and <b>compass navigation</b>.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                    <h2>Natural Navigation</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            A common way to use <b>natural navigation</b> is to follow the edge of a reef or large landmark on your way out and when you turn around, just follow it back. Another way is to use <b>slopes and shadows</b> from <b>sunlight</b> or <b>wave direction</b>. These are of course only possible if you have a <em>clear</em> dive site with landmarks etc.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                    <h2> Compass Navigation </h2>
                                        <p>
                                            The more <b>difficult</b> but more <b>precise</b> way to navigate underwater is using a <b>compass</b>. <i>Compass Navigation</i> takes some <b>practice</b> on land and underwater before relying on it for your dive. With simple compass navigation we <b>set our compass</b> for the direction we are heading and watch that we <b>don’t veer off course</b>. Then when we want to return, we turn <b>180 degrees</b> to swim back the way we came. 
                                        </p>
                                
                                        <p>
                                            If we don’t want to swim in a straight line and back then we can make more <em>complex shapes</em> such as squares and triangles also using a compass. For this we <b>either decide our path</b> before the dive or use a <b>slate underwater</b> to write down how far we went before each turn, and how many degrees we turned. 
                                        </p>
