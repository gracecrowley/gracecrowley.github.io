                                            Pieces of <b>lead</b> usually between 1 and 5 Lbs. Weights can be attached to the <em>weight belt</em> or placed in <em>special weight pockets</em> in the BCD.

                                            Due to the body <em>losing heat</em> faster in water, <b>exposure protection</b>, such as a wetsuit, is generally advisable.
